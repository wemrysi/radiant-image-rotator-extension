= Image Rotator

Adds tags that allow you to display a random image from a directory of images
that changes each time the page is loaded.

The <r:rotator /> tag has two attributes, "type" and "dir."  Type allows you to
specify an extension to limit and defaults to "jpg."  Dir should be a path
under the public/images path of your radiant installation that points to the
directory containing the images you want to display.

To use the rotator, simply supply the <r:rotator dir="" [type=""] /> tag for the
"src" attribute of an <img /> tag.
